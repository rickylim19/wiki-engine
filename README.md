# Wiki-Engine

Wiki-Engine was inspired from the final wiki project of [CS253-Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253). I must say the course is among the **best** online course I've ever followed. Many thanks to *Steve and the team*.

Wiki-engine supports:
- Wikipage with version history
- Quote addition (with random view of the quotes on the front page)
- Markdown + Math equations with preview. Thanks to [kercol](https://github.com/kerzol/markdown-mathjax) for the markdown editor. 
- JSON API for wikipages (/pages.json) and quotes (/quotes.json)

Technology applied:
- Google Appengine (python) for web server
- Bootstrap for styling
- Jinja2 for templating

**Note**:
For better editing experience, wiki-engine is best run on firefox with [It's All Text](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/its-all-text/) plugin. This plugin allows us to edit the textarea using vim-editor.
